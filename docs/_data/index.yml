- description: Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current
    structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived
    automatically from existing published content but published on a different site.
    For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing
    content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps
    make such practices more explicit.
  title: sdPublisher
- description: You can provide a single point that describes the spatial aspect of
    the dataset. Only include this property if the dataset has a spatial dimension.
    For example, a single point where all the measurements were collected, or the
    coordinates of a bounding box for an area.
  title: spatialCoverage
- description: 'The data in the dataset covers a specific time interval. Only include
    this property if the dataset has a temporal dimension. Schema.org uses the ISO

    differently depending upon the dataset interval. Indicate open-ended intervals
    with two decimal points (..). TODO: adjust validation for these specific cases!'
  title: temporalCoverage
- description: A string or text indicating the actual unit of measurement (which maybe
    different to the canonical_units). In general this should be of the form 'm /
    s', leave a space between each character. Use SI prefix symbols; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix.
    Dimensionless units are indicated by '1'.
  title: unitText
