    human-readable version of the value, put that into the 'description' property.
    Always use specific schema.org properties when a) they exist and b) you can populate
    them. Using PropertyValue as a substitute will typically not trigger the same
    effect as using the original, specific property.

- description: If the dataset is a collection of smaller datasets, use the hasPart
    property to denote such relationship. Can take the form of an array of URL(s)
    or a Dataset objects.
  title: hasPart
- description: An identifier, such as a DOI or a Compact Identifier. If the dataset
    has more than one identifier, repeat the identifier property as an array.

- description: The technique, technology, or methodology used in a dataset, which
    can correspond to the variable(s) described in variableMeasured. The measurementTechnique

    the connections to the data of the dataset.
  title: providers
- description: Use the sameAs property to indicate the most canonical URLs for the
    original in cases when the dataset or description is a simple republication of
    materials published elsewhere. The value of sameAs needs to unambiguously indicate
    the datasets identity - in other words two different datasets should not use the
    same URL as sameAs value.
  title: sameAs
- description: Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current
    structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived
    automatically from existing published content but published on a different site.
    For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing
    content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps
    make such practices more explicit.
  title: sdPublisher
- description: You can provide a single point that describes the spatial aspect of
    the dataset. Only include this property if the dataset has a spatial dimension.
    For example, a single point where all the measurements were collected, or the
    coordinates of a bounding box for an area.
  title: spatialCoverage
- description: The data in the dataset covers a specific time interval. Only include
    this property if the dataset has a temporal dimension. Schema.org uses the ISO
    8601 standard to describe time intervals and time points. You can describe dates
    differently depending upon the dataset interval. Indicate open-ended intervals
    with two decimal points (..).
  title: temporalCoverage
- description: ISO-8601 time timestamp string.
  title: time
- description: A string or text indicating the unit of measurement. Useful if you
    cannot provide a standard unit code for unitCode.
  title: unitText
- description: String representing a URI.
  title: uri
- description: The variable that this dataset measures. For example, temperature or
    pressure. The variableMeasured property is proposed and pending standardization
    at schema.org, see https://pending.webschemas.org/variableMeasured.
  title: variableMeasured
- description: The version number for the entity. If no versioning is given, consider
    using semantic versioning (1.0.0) or the publication date
